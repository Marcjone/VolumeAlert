The program serves as a scanner for American stock actions (NASDAQ/NYSE/AMEX). It works best during the early pre-market hours. The application fetches the average volume from the https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/{SymbolYahoo} website and saves the value to a database. After registering the list of symbols to the TOS feed through the Ppro8 API, it tracks the executed turnover. If the executed volume for the day exceeds a certain percentage of the average volume (e.g., 40%), it serves as an early signal for speculative/insider activity, indicating potential market movement in the upcoming session. The program can either send an alert or immediately place an order based on liquidity. (NOTE: It is recommended to start with a small initial size, e.g., 100 shares, and increase positions as the situation develops). The project includes a list of around 500 low-float companies with prices up to $5. This type of companies is characterized by significant price movements within individual sessions.
